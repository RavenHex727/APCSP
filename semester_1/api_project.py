# ASSIGNMENT STARTS HERE

# FIRST WRITE A COMMENT DESCRIBING YOUR ALGORITHM
# HOW WILL YOUR ALGORITHM WORK? WHAT IS THE HEURISTIC YOU ARE USING? WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE TOO MUCH HOMEWORK AND NOT ENOUGH MINUTES? WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE ENOUGH MINUTES TO COMPLETE AN ASSIGNMENT HALFWAY, BUT NOT COMPLETELY? WALK ME THROUGH AN EXAMPLE WITH A FEW ASSIGNMENTS.  
'''
- My heuristic will be to do whatever has the nearest due date first. 
    - sort assignments into a dictionary based on due date
        -sort each list in the dictionary by priority
        - order the dictionary by the key (due date)
        - create a list of the dictionary values, which are in the order of due date and then priority

Part 1:
    - If there are assignments due tomorrow:
        - Immediately add to today homework list, regardless of time needed.
        - If there is extra time, do whatever other assignments I can
        - Remainding time will be added to tomorrow's homework time

    - If there are assignments due dayafter:
        - Loop through all the assignments
            - If there is time to do some of it day today (after adding all the homework due tomorrow if applicable)
                - add to today's homework list

            - All the other assignments due the day after will be tomorrow's homework

Part 2 (will run regardless of the due date of assignments. If part 1 is applicable, it will run after part 1):
    - Loop through all the assignments
        - If I have enough time for the assignment
            - do it

        - If not, leave it in the to-do list

    - Add remainding homework time to the next day
    - repeat for tomorrow and day after
